    // --------  Assignment 3  --------
    //  At the end of assignment 2 we've seen how quickly it can become messy if you don't watch out
    //  In this assignment we're going to clean up that mess and have it behave like you'd expect it to
    //  First off, please note the bitmask that's defined in the ViewController class, that bitmask will represent
    //      what nodes our pin can interact with so we get rid of the unwanted collisions
    //
    //  1. Let's start by setting the collisionBitmask and categoryBitmask of both the pin and the rect to the value of bitmask
    //      Our pin can collide with it's own rect now but unless we change the bitmask it can collide with others as well
    //  2. Let's bitwise shift our bitmask 1 further by assigning it bitmask << 1
    //      To prevent getting stuck add an if statement to check if bitmask == 0 and if it is assign 1 to it
    //      Run the code and see how the behavior is better already but collissions are still possible
    //  3. Let's clean up the boxes first though, set the rect it's lineWidth to 0 and our app is much cleaner already
    //  4. Now for the final step let's get rid of the last collissions
    //      Add an asyncAfter 2 seconds where we're going to set the physicsBody of the pin and the rect to nil
    //      Just for good measure let's set the pin.position.y to 0 as well
    //
    //
    //
    //  Run the app again and notice how it behaves like you'd expect it to
    //  There are still limitations since this is a 2d world mapped in a 3d space but you're already able to build cool stuff
    //  Note that if you get further away the framework will handle everything for you but also note how you can still see pins through walls
    //
    //  In the next assignments we're going to take a look at how to create a 3d world with SceneKit
